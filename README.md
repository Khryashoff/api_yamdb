## Description
The YaMDb project collects user "Reviews" of works. Unfortunately, the works themselves are not stored in YaMDb, you can't watch a movie or listen to music here, but you can read about them.
The works are divided into categories such as "Books", "Movies", "Music".
A work can be assigned a "Genre" from the preset list.
Only the administrator can add works, categories and genres.
You can come to us and leave an assessment on the work you like, write an enthusiastic review for it, or vice versa, share your indignation at the next film from the Star WarsÂ© saga. On the basis of the obtained estimates, an average estimate of the work is formed - a rating.
Users can leave "Comments" to reviews.
Only authenticated users can add reviews, comments and ratings, so please register.

## Launching a project in dev mode
1. Clone the repository and go to it on the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khryashoff/api_yamdb.git
```
```bash
cd api_yamdb/
```
2. Install and activate the virtual environment for the project:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
```bash
# for OS Windows
. venv/Scripts/activate
```
3. Update pip and install dependencies from the file requirements.txt:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Perform migrations at the project level:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
5. Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
6. Start the project:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## User registration algorithm
1. The user sends a POST request to add a new user.
```
POST /api/v1/auth/signup/
```

Pass user data to body:
```json
{
"email": "string",
"username": "string"
}
```
2. YaMDB sends an email with a confirmation code (confirmation_code) to the email address.
3. The user sends a POST request to receive a JWT token. 
```
POST /api/v1/auth/token/
```

Pass user data to body:
```json
{
"username": "string",
"confirmation_code": "string"
}
```

Specify the received token in the Authorization field to access the full functionality of the project:
```
Authorization: Bearer Token {your_token}
```

4. If desired, the user sends a PATCH request to fill in the information in his profile (the description of the fields is in the documentation).
```
PATCH /api/v1/users/me/
```
